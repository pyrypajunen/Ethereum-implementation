# Ethereum Implementation (The portfolio is in progress)
## Learning purpose (Ethereum and Solidity)
During these three small projects, I've learned to use Truffle, Ganache, Open Zeppelin, Metamask, Solidity and web3.js library. I studied the theory behind those technologies as well, which helps me to understand Ethereum blockchain development deeper.

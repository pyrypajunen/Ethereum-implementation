# Ethereum Implementation (The portfolio is in progress)
## Ethereum and Solidity

I've learned to use Truffle, Ganache, Open Zeppelin, Metamask, Solidity, React, and web3.js libraries during these projects. Also, I used chai and mocha frameworks for testing my smart contracts. I also studied the theory behind those technologies, which helped me understand Ethereum blockchain development deeper. 

I started to develop my own NFT marketplace like OpenSea.

I am constantly learning more things about smart contract development; I keep this portfolio in progress. These projects are only for learning purposes.
